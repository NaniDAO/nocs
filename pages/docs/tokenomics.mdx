# token

NANI (the nani token) is onchain on ethereum and base at the same address, [0x00000000000007C8612bA63Df8DdEfD9E6077c97](https://etherscan.io/token/0x00000000000007c8612ba63df8ddefd9e6077c97).

## purpose

The nani token gives any wallet the right to influence and benefit more from nani OS. It was [distributed initially](https://github.com/NaniDAO/NaniDAO) to contributors, testers, and for bounties.

nani OS includes the [nani.eth onchain domain](https://app.ens.domains/nani.eth) and related apps with their data, protocol smart contracts, such as [Accounts.sol](https://github.com/NaniDAO/accounts), [CheckTheChain.sol](https://github.com/NaniDAO/ctc) and [IE.sol](https://github.com/NaniDAO/ie/tree/main), fee switches in the nani paymaster (NEETH), as well as the [0xDa0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDa000000000000d2885F108500803dfBAaB2f2aA) treasury itself and related property rights.

Other properties include the org [GitHub](https://github.com/NaniDAO) and [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/NaniDAO) code repositories.

### voting utility

The nani token must be staked into xNANI to receive the right to vote over nani OS.

xNANI is onchain on ethereum and base at the same address, [0x000000000000629d5F7ce20b868D0Ac1739104B9](https://etherscan.io/token/0x000000000000629d5f7ce20b868d0ac1739104b9).

Voting is enabled for core protocol contracts on ethereum through Moloch V4, *Dagon*, [0x000000000000FEb893BB5D63bA33323EdCC237cE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000feb893bb5d63ba33323edcc237ce#code). The initial quorum to pass threshold is 9,999,999 âŒ˜ (1% of the total supply), managed initially by the DAO admin, [recovery.nani.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000001d8a2e7bf6bc369525A2654aa298#code) (ops), currently overseeing the community airdrop, bounty programs, and LP incentives.

Signal voting is also enabled for xNANI holders through iterative governance processes available on [dao.nani.eth.limo](https://dao.nani.eth.limo/) on both ethereum and base.

Active participation is encouraged and will be granted additional incentives over time. Staking can be [activated on UI](https://x.nanistaker.eth.limo/) or via [nani chat](https://nani.ooo/chat).

### staking utility

Protocol revenue and incentives are currently airdropped on all xNANI stakers on ethereum and base. These are unpredictable, and come from ops, or from the mint of the [genesis NaniMaker NFTs](https://magiceden.io/collections/base/0x2a2d025a77c41f987f3292ca922dd893cb66ca1a).

The goal of the initial incentives period is to encourage a critical mass of xNANI stakers to better guarantee the security of xNANI voteable processes within nani OS.

### access rights

Access to certain digital spaces will be granted exclusively to xNANI holders; initially, the right to comment on related comms channels in discord or elsewhere. Additionally, xNANI holders are guaranteed early access to premium nani OS features, such as new software releases, as well as [unlimited chat with nani OS agents](https://nani.ooo/chat) (for 999 xNANI, to start, subject to governance).

## distribution program

The nani token is currently in [phase1](https://github.com/NaniDAO/NaniDAO), with target distribution of 33.33%.

~10% of the supply is available for airdrop to select communities until 1/11. This process was started on 11/1, recently paused to fix a sybil issue with nani OS tester points, and shall resume no later than 1/9.

1% of this phase1 supply has been bridged to base to reduce the cost of airdrops and bounties in a DAO-owned smart account.

nani token can also be obtained from the [play site](https://nani.ooo/play), which features different things users can do for more nani tokens. Starting with familiar defi actions, such as *lp*, and *swap*, but will include reputational and other games as nani OS increases its network of active participants.

33.33% of nani tokens are further allocated to the 0xDa0 treasury, which following phase1, should be subject to more robust governance and activation. The remaining 33.33% is allocated to a timelock that returns this sum to ops 1/11, which is under the multisignature key of [z0r0z](https://x.com/z0r0zzz), [cattin](https://x.com/Cattin0x), [shiv](https://x.com/nerderlyne), and an [agent](https://app.ens.domains/agent.nani.eth?tab=records). The goal of the ops wallet is to initialize other ai-assisted orgs in the nani network as their studio, starting with dogfooding itself as a devCo co-managed by nani OS, and continue to build cutting-edge, high production-value software aligned with the nani DAO, well into the future.

Any remaining nani token from these calculations shall be earmarked for the nani OS agent. To incentive itself through reward tokens, and also allow it to give out tokens to grow a more diverse network of collaborators, at its own discretion, subject to recall by the nani DAO.
