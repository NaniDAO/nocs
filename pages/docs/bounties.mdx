# Bounties

NANI OS is shifting to bounty incentives after closing its initial beta period (1/11) of user testing.

These bounties are onchain SVG NFTs that contain details of each bounty proposal (or request), on Base chain.

Users and prospective bounty solvers can propose a bounty using [this interface](https://nanibounty.eth.limo/).

The admin may then accept this request, as well issue its own. Following completion, the bounty NFT will be minted for redemption.

The average bounty amount currently is 999 âŒ˜.

The redemption contract is WIP and will be posted in discord after initial testing. But will also be on Base to ensure low fees.

# Deployment

[0x0000000000b2AF9d57d12F011591abE3F6CE50c0](https://opensea.io/collection/nani-bounties-4)

Bounties are issued by the [OS Admin](0x999657A41753b8E69C66e7b1A8E37d513CB44E1C), until [the DAO](https://basescan.org/address/0xDa000000000000d2885F108500803dfBAaB2f2aA#code) on Base is configured following the end of the beta.

The NANI OS agent account (0x466d3E0E6D661d6E7626e9dea93c460BD4e15B40) will also provide bounties as well as tipping. These updates will also be published in discord when ready.
