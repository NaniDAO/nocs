Pick a wallet of choice that supports EVM, clicks **Connect** on wallet popup.

Now you should be seeing the NANI dashboard and a setup window, press the **Setup** button and sign the transaction from your wallet popup (essentially by signing the transaction, you create a NANI smart account).

After creating your NANI smart account, you will be asked to perform a **System Upgrade** (This is a feature that sets a limit to your withdrawal to prevent wallet drain). You can set the number depending on your risk appetite, then press the **Upgrade with x% Withdrawal Limit** button to proceed (In this case I have set it to 10%), sign the transaction from your wallet popup.

NANI will then offer you a tour, press **Skip** and voila you have now done with your account setup!
