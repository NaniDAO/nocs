# IE (Intents Engine)

The Intents Engine (IE) is a smart contract and natural language router designed to facilitate transaction execution through natural language processing for Nani users and agents.

## Contract Details
- **Version**: v1.3.0
- **Address**: `0x1e00002C59149d0057F12e031ecC0000d38A000C`

## Overview

IE translates natural language commands into executable onchain transactions. It works in conjunction with the Nani app which features a Llama3-abliterated chat model for generating userOps and transaction analysis.

## Key Features

- Natural language processing for transaction creation
- Integration with Nani userOps system
- Support for common commands like token transfers and swaps
- Human-readable transaction generation

## Examples

User commands like:
- "send 10 ETH to nanidao.eth"
- "swap 1 ether to bitcoin"

Are translated into calldata and packed into transactions compatible with bundler networks.

## Interface

An EOA interface is available at [ie.nani.ooo](https://ie.nani.ooo/)

## Integration

IE processes natural language inputs and converts them to structured transaction data that can be:
1. Validated by smart contracts
2. Executed through bundler networks
3. Verified by users in a human-readable format
