# IE (Intents Engine)

The Intents Engine (IE) is a smart contract and natural language router designed to facilitate transaction execution through natural language processing for NANI users and agents.

## Contract Details

Mainnet
- V2.3.0: `0x1e000000004D0547006B4e83D4727bF62800B402`

Arbitrum
- V2.3.0: `0x1e003A9F2EF4110000bF74001B982cf8Ba790000`

Base
- V2.3.0: `0x1e4FE500980000D7679EcE0000D000B49E740493`

Optimism
- V2: `0x1eaf8F6A000013F1960000E4e34106690000925b`

## Overview

IE translates natural language commands into executable onchain transactions. It works in conjunction with the Nani app which features a Llama3-abliterated chat model for generating userOps and transaction analysis.

## Key Features

- Natural language processing for transaction creation
- Integration with Nani userOps system
- Support for common commands like token transfers and swaps
- Human-readable transaction generation

## Examples

User commands like:
- "send 10 ETH to nanidao"
- "swap 1 ether to bitcoin"

Are translated into calldata and packed into transactions compatible with bundler networks.

## Interface

An EOA interface is available at [ie.nani.ooo](https://ie.nani.ooo/), as well as [intentsengine.eth.limo](https://intentsengine.eth.limo), and [ie.nani.eth.limo](https://ie.nani.eth.limo).

## Integration

IE processes natural language inputs and converts them to structured transaction data that can be:
1. Validated by smart contracts
2. Executed through bundler networks
3. Verified by users in a human-readable format
