# IE

The [Intents Engine (IE)](https://docs.nani.ooo/docs/ie) is a defi router that parses natural language into executable calldata.

This protects user intents against malformed txs that don't accurately reflect their goals. 

It also provides a simple way for LLM and other agents to have tx-capabilities today: just summarize requests into commands.

## Syntax

Commands are strings. They should be intuitive to what you would say to another person or type into a terminal.

*Note:* 

- Token Symbols and usernames can upper-or-lowercase. IE normalizes all text into lowercase. 

- "for/to" are interchangeable.

- You can also use an 0x address for token or user if you don't know their symbol/username or IE doesn't.

Here are examples of the command syntax that works with IE to route commands:

### Swaps

Initially, Uniswapv3 pool swaps. Therefore tokens should have a pool.

#### Exact-in

- "swap 20 DAI to ETH"

#### Min-out

- "swap 4000 DAI for 1 ETH"

#### Exact-out

- "swap USDC to 1 ETH"

#### Swap-for-user

Simply add a "to"/for" after swap with username or 0x address.

- "swap USDC to 1 ETH for vitalik"

- "swap USDC for 1 ETH for 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"

### Sends

- "send z0r0z 20 dai"

- "send 20 dai to z0r0z"

### Escrows

The depositor controls release. Can reclaim after timelock.

- "escrow nick 20 dai for 99 days"

### Lockups

The recipient controls release after timelock. Can refund back to depositor.

- "lock nick 20 dai for 99 days"

### Orders

Create an onchain order within the IE orderbook. Supports ETH, ERC20 and ERC721.

- "order 1 weth for 4000 dai"
