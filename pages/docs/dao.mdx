# DAO

NANI DAO is a chartered [DUNA organization (NANI DUNA)](https://github.com/NaniDAO/NaniDAO). 

The voting mechanism is [Dagon (Moloch V4)](https://github.com/Moloch-Mystics/dagon). 

Governance tokens were initially distributed to users in the public beta phase for testing and feedback.

An airdrop was also conducted from 11/1 - 1/11, targeting select communities and other DAOs.

[Staking](https://x.nanistaker.eth.limo/) is required to activate governance rights, and [votes are posted in discord, as well as onchain](https://dao.nani.eth.limo/).
