# DAO

NANI DAO is a chartered DUNA organization (NANI DUNA). The voting mechanism is Dagon (Moloch V4). The tokens are distributed initially to users in the public beta phase starting 6/27/2024, while users who started the private testing phase have been eligible since 6/6/2024.

Each day +1111 DAO token credits are allocated to your Account. These can be tracked in the Account dashboard made available on nani.ooo. Staking is required to activate governance rights. Credits can be claimed through the app (soon) via the distribution contract.

The scope of effective and proposed delegation of responsibilities from the kali.gg team operating Nani Kotoba DAO LLC for the benefit of NANI DUNA are as follows:

Account implementation versioning and upgrades

IE token labeling and swap routing

nani/om (open model) selection, safety params, and alignment

More details will be made available following the public beta. But discussion can be currently had on telegram or discord.
