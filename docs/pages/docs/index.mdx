# Getting Started

The simplest way to interact with NaNi as a developer is to clone the *[Accounts](https://github.com/NaniDAO/accounts)* repository.

## Installation

To install with [**Foundry**](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry):

```sh
forge install NaniDAO/accounts
```

To install with [**Hardhat**](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat):

```sh
npm install NaniDAO/accounts
```

The following terminal commands will allow you to run tests and simulate transactions with NaNi Accounts.

Run: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && source ~/.bashrc && foundryup` to install the *[foundry](https://foundry.paradigm.xyz)* contract testing suite.

Build the NaNi Accounts foundry project with `forge build`. Run contract tests with `forge test`. Measure gas fees with `forge snapshot`. Format code with `forge fmt`.
